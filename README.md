# universalvideomaximizer
Chrome extension that finds and enlarges the main video filling browser window.

## Branches
Because Chrome is going through a major API update (which has some compatiblity issues), there are TWO major branches.

The `main` branch is an older snapshot of the classic extentions. 

## v2 
The `v2` branch is fixes to this classic version and
is currently what's published publically in the Chrome store.

## v3 BETA
The `v3` branch uses the new chrome API v3. It's fully functional and can be found in the chrome store here:

It is currently "unlisted" while it's in beta testing. I keep finding/reporting Chrome bugs with the v3 manifest, so it's taking longer to release.


## Firefox support
The `v2` branch that is verified to work with Firefox.
Once it's approved, the Add-On link will go [here].
