# universalvideomaximizer
Chrome extension that finds and enlarges the main video filling browser window.

## Branches
Because Chrome is going through a major API update (which has some compatiblity issues), there are TWO major branches.

The `main` branch is an older snapshot of the classic extentions. The `v2` branch is fixes to this classic version and
is currently what's published publically in the Chrome store.

The `v3` branch uses the new chrome API v3. It's fully functional and can be found in the chrome store here:

## Decisions about future
The `v3` Chrome API is going to break a bunch of users who are on Firefox. It would be nice to update the older
`v2` store listing with and get the almost 5 star rating carried over to the improved extenstion; however, that
like break a bunch of Firefox users.

Could have competing extensions, but the brand message would be very confusing. 

Would like to create a new Video Maximizer Classic listing, but Google isn't accepting v2 API extentions anymore.
